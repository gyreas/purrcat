This is any large file with many lines of text, currently it's 100k+ lines of text. Here's one way to generate it:
  ```
  $ touch consistent.txt
  $ for ((i=0; i < 47; i++)); do cat file1 file2 ... >> consistent.txt; done
  ```
For starters you can simply use app/App.java since it's long enough, but it's probably best to mix some other files too.

While binary files can now be catenated, there are still rough edges. Testing on files 1Mib to 5Mib large should be quick enough to see results.

This file is not meant to be committed beyond this first addition.
